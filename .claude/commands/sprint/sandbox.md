Usage: `/sprint:sandbox [component]`

## Sprint 5 Overview
**Focus:** Secure subprocess sandbox execution with performance optimization
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Priority:** Critical execution safety
**Dependencies:** Sprint 4 Capability System (COMPLETED âœ…)

## Implementation Goals

### 1. Subprocess Sandbox Implementation
- **Process Isolation**: True process-level isolation for ML code execution
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, file size, network controls
- **Capability Integration**: Forward capability contexts across process boundaries
- **Security Monitoring**: Violation tracking and prevention

### 2. Performance Optimization Engine
- **Compilation Caching**: Cache parsed ASTs and generated Python code
- **Capability Caching**: Optimize capability lookup performance (<0.01ms target)
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage patterns
- **JIT Compilation**: Explore just-in-time optimization opportunities

### 3. Secure Code Execution
- **Sandboxed Python**: Execute generated Python code in isolated subprocess
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time resource usage tracking
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful handling of long-running code
- **Error Propagation**: Secure error reporting across process boundaries

### 4. Development Tooling
- **Debugging Support**: Debugger integration within sandbox constraints
- **Profiling Tools**: Performance profiling for sandbox execution
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time execution metrics
- **Security Auditing**: Comprehensive security validation tools

## Security Architecture

### Subprocess Isolation
```python
with MLSandbox(
    memory_limit="100MB",
    cpu_timeout=30.0,
    file_access_patterns=["*.txt"],
    network_disabled=True
) as sandbox:
    result = sandbox.execute(ml_code, capabilities=[file_token])
```

### Resource Controls
- **Memory Limits**: Configurable memory constraints per execution
- **CPU Limits**: Timeout and CPU usage monitoring
- **File System**: Restricted file access via capability patterns
- **Network**: Optional network isolation or restricted access

### Capability Forwarding
- **Context Serialization**: Safe capability context transfer to subprocess
- **Token Validation**: Verify capability tokens in sandbox environment
- **Permission Inheritance**: Maintain capability hierarchy across processes
- **Security Boundaries**: Ensure no privilege escalation

## Performance Targets

### Execution Performance
- **Sandbox Startup**: <100ms cold start time
- **Code Execution**: <10ms overhead compared to direct Python execution
- **Memory Overhead**: <50MB base memory usage
- **Capability Checks**: <0.01ms per capability validation

### Compilation Performance
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% for repeated code compilation
- **Parse Time**: <1ms for typical ML programs
