# Sprint 4: Capability System Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

Implementation of production-ready capability-based security system for mlpy v2.0.

Usage: `/sprint:capabilities [component]`

## Sprint 4 Overview - COMPLETED ✅
**Focus:** Production-ready capability-based security system
**Duration:** 1 sprint iteration (Completed September 24, 2025)
**Priority:** Critical security foundation
**Status:** ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED

## Implementation Process

### 1. Core Capability Token System
- **CapabilityToken Class**: UUID-based tokens with JSON constraints + expiration
- **Resource Patterns**: Glob pattern matching for file/network/system access
- **Constraint Validation**: Runtime constraint checking with performance optimization
- **Token Lifecycle**: Creation, validation, expiration, revocation

### 2. Capability Manager Implementation
- **Thread-Safe Context**: RLock-protected capability context hierarchy
- **Parent-Child Inheritance**: Capability inheritance with restriction patterns
- **Context Switching**: Fast context transitions for nested capability scopes
- **Performance Cache**: O(1) capability lookups via hashmap caching

### 3. System Module Integration
- **Safe Built-ins**: Hardened replacements for dangerous functions
  - `math_safe`: Safe mathematical operations with capability checks
  - `file_safe`: File system access with resource pattern validation
  - `network_safe`: Network operations with URL/port restrictions
- **Capability Decorators**: `@requires_capability()` for function protection
- **Runtime Validation**: Automatic capability requirement checking

### 4. CallbackBridge Implementation
- **Secure Communication**: System ↔ ML bidirectional communication bridge
- **Capability Forwarding**: Propagate capabilities across system boundaries
- **Sandbox Integration**: Bridge between sandboxed execution and host system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation with security context

## Security Architecture

### Token-Based Access Control
```python
@requires_capability("file.read", pattern="*.txt")
def read_text_file(filename):
    # Only callable with appropriate capability token
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()
```

### Context Hierarchy
```python
with FileAccess_capability() as file_cap:
    with NetworkAccess_capability() as net_cap:
        # Nested capability context with inheritance
        process_data_with_file_and_network()
```

### Runtime Validation
- **Capability Check Performance**: Target <0.01ms per check
- **Thread Safety**: Full concurrent access support
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal overhead for capability storage
- **Security Boundaries**: Strong isolation between capability contexts

## Integration Points

### Parser Integration
- **Capability Statements**: `capability FileAccess { ... }` in ML grammar
- **Security Analysis**: Automatic capability requirement detection
- **Code Generation**: Generate Python capability context managers

### Runtime System Integration
- **Safe Execution Environment**: All system access through capability checks
- **Sandbox Compatibility**: Capability system works within sandbox boundaries
- **Error Propagation**: Security errors with capability context information

### CLI Integration
- **Capability Debugging**: `mlpy audit --capabilities` command
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Capability usage reporting and analysis
- **Security Validation**: Capability system integrity checks
