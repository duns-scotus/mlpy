# ML Language Security Audit

Comprehensive security analysis of ML language features, runtime system, and transpilation pipeline with focus on exploit prevention and security boundary enforcement.

Usage: `/ml-compiler:security-audit [scope]`

## Audit Scope

### 1. Language Features Security
**Focus:** Security implications of all ML language constructs

#### Core Language Security Analysis
- **Variable Scoping**: Prevent variable pollution across security boundaries
- **Function Definitions**: Ensure function isolation and capability requirements
- **Control Flow**: Validate security in loops, conditionals, and exception handling
- **Expression Evaluation**: Prevent code injection through expression manipulation
- **Object/Array Access**: Validate property access doesn't bypass security

#### Dangerous Operation Detection
```ml
// These should be BLOCKED by security analysis:
result = eval("malicious_code");           // Code injection risk
data = __import__("os").system("rm -rf"); // Dangerous import
secret = obj.__class__.__bases__[0];      // Reflection abuse
file = open("/etc/passwd", "r");          // Unrestricted file access
```

### 2. Runtime Security Analysis
**Focus:** Security of capability system, sandbox, and safe built-ins

#### Capability System Security
- **Token Validation**: Cryptographic integrity of capability tokens
- **Context Isolation**: Prevent capability leakage between contexts
- **Inheritance Rules**: Validate parent-child capability inheritance
- **Expiration Handling**: Ensure expired tokens are properly invalidated
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Validate resource pattern matching security

#### Sandbox Security Boundaries
- **Process Isolation**: Verify true process separation for ML execution
- **Resource Limits**: Validate CPU, memory, file size, network restrictions
- **System Call Filtering**: Ensure dangerous system calls are blocked
- **File System Access**: Validate file access is properly sandboxed
- **Network Isolation**: Ensure network access respects capability constraints

### 3. Security Report Generation
