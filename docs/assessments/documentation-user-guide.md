## Coverage Analysis by User Type

### For Complete Beginners (Learning to Code)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

#### What Works
- ✅ Tutorial starts from absolute basics
- ✅ REPL makes experimentation easy
- ✅ Progressive difficulty
- ✅ Hands-on examples

#### What Doesn't Work
- ❌ No "Programming Fundamentals" primer
- ❌ Assumes basic computer literacy
- ❌ Limited "thinking like a programmer" guidance
- ❌ No comparison to other languages
- ❌ Missing structured exercises

#### Verdict
A motivated beginner could learn, but this isn't "Learn Programming with ML" - it's "Learn ML (assuming basic programming knowledge)". **Requires supplementary material for true beginners.**

---

### For Experienced Programmers

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

#### What Works
- ✅ Language Reference is comprehensive
- ✅ Toolkit docs are exceptional
- ✅ Can jump right in
- ✅ Clear, precise syntax documentation

- ✅ Similar control structures

#### What's Missing
- ❌ No explicit "ML for Python Devs" guide
- ❌ No comparison table (Python vs ML)
- ❌ No migration guide
- ❌ Key differences not highlighted upfront

#### Verdict
Will figure it out quickly, but could be smoother with a dedicated comparison guide. **This is likely the largest user segment.**

---

### As a Reference Manual

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

#### What Works
- ✅ Language Reference is complete
- ✅ Searchable structure

#### What's Missing
- ❌ No centralized error guide
- ❌ No FAQ section
- ❌ No "Common Problems" reference
- ❌ No error message decoder
- ❌ User has to guess where to look

#### What Exists
- ⚠️ Some troubleshooting in individual sections

- "When Things Go Wrong" guide
- Debugging checklist
- FAQ section

**Example Problem:**
```
User gets: "NameError: undefined variable 'x'"
Where do they look? No centralized troubleshooting section.
They have to search through multiple docs.
```

**Recommendation:** Create `user-guide/troubleshooting.rst` with:
- Common error messages and solutions
