**Example Circuit Breaker:**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED

    def call(self, ml_code):
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            if datetime.now() - self.last_failure_time > timedelta(seconds=self.timeout):
                self.state = CircuitState.HALF_OPEN
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker is OPEN")
        # ... implementation
```

async def benchmark_ml_code():
    tester = PerformanceTester()
    results = await tester.benchmark_async_execution(ml_code, iterations=100)
    print(f"Mean: {results['mean']*1000:.2f}ms")
```

        injection_payloads = [
            'result = eval("__import__(\\"os\\").system(\\"ls\\")");',
            # ... more payloads
        ]
        for payload in injection_payloads:
            try:
                self.tester.test_payload(payload)
                print("❌ VULNERABILITY")
            except SecurityError:
