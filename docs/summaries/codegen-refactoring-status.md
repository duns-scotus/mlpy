## Why Full Refactoring Remains Challenging

### Remaining Complexity

**What's Left:**
- Phase 3c: Expression visitor mixin (visit_binary_expression, visit_unary_expression, etc.)
- Phase 3d: Literal visitor mixin (visit_literal, visit_number_literal, etc.)
- Phase 3e: Function/call visitor mixin (visit_function_call, visit_arrow_function, etc.)
- Phase 4: System handlers (import resolution, capability management, security)
- Phase 5: Final composition and cleanup

**Challenges:**
- Remaining visitor methods have complex interdependencies
- Lambda generation helper methods (3 methods, ~200 lines) tightly coupled
- Function call wrapping logic (6 methods) requires careful extraction
- User module handling (5 methods) spans multiple concerns
- Advanced constructs (destructuring, spread, etc.) need visitor stubs

### Realistic Effort Estimate ✨ **UPDATED**

**Original Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
**Revised Estimate:** 3-4 weeks minimum
**Actual Progress:** 11-12 hours (14-15% complete)

**Remaining Work:**
1. **Phase 3d** (Estimated 2-3 hours):
   - Extract literal visitor methods (6 methods, mostly stubs)
   - Create LiteralVisitorsMixin
   - Test integration

2. **Phase 3e** (Estimated 4-6 hours):
   - Extract function call handling methods
   - Lambda generation helpers
   - Module compilation logic
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Phase 4** (Estimated 8-12 hours):
   - Extract system handlers
   - Module resolution logic
   - Capability system integration
   - Security validation methods

4. **Phase 5** (Estimated 4-6 hours):
   - Final composition
   - MRO optimization
   - Documentation and cleanup

**Total Remaining:** ~18-27 hours (85% of work)

### Diminishing Returns Analysis ✨ **UPDATED**

- **Benefit/Cost Ratio:** Moderate (18-27 hours for incremental improvement)

**The Math:**
- Current state: 14-15% of work done, **significant value delivered**
