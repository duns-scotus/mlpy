# mlpy Enhancement Proposals: Implementation Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - In Progress
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for four interconnected proposals plus comprehensive integration documentation that will transform mlpy into a production-ready, Python-integrable ML language system. The proposals address the three critical barriers identified in [integration-patterns-analysis.md](../integration-patterns-analysis.md):

1. **Module Extension Complexity** (6 steps → 1 step) - ✅ **COMPLETE**
2. **Synchronous Blocking** (no async execution) - 🔄 **PLANNED**
3. **No ML-as-Callback** (no event-driven integration) - 🔄 **PLANNED**

**Current Progress:** Proposals #1 & #2 complete (5 weeks), 98.7% test coverage + 94.4% test success
**Remaining Timeline:** 6-8 weeks for Proposal #3 + 2-3 weeks for Proposal #4 + 2-3 weeks for documentation
**Total Timeline:** 15-19 weeks (5 weeks complete, 10-14 weeks remaining)
**Impact:** Production-ready Python-ML integration with elegant developer experience and exhaustive documentation

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → Documentation

```

```

**Original Timeline:** 16 weeks for implementation
**With Documentation:** 19 weeks total (22 weeks with buffer)
**Current Progress:** 5 weeks complete (Phases 1 & 2)
**Remaining:** 10 weeks minimum (14 weeks with buffer)

---

## Why This Order?

### Dependency Resolution
✅ **Proposal #2 depends ONLY on #1** (not #3)
- Can implement immediately after #1
- Delivers immediate value to module developers

✅ **Proposal #3 Component 1 references #1**
- No duplication of auto-detection implementation
- Clean architectural separation

✅ **Proposal #4 depends on #3**
- Needs full toolkit to provide debugging/monitoring

### Value Delivery Timeline

| Week | Milestone | User Impact |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 4 | Auto-detection complete ✅ | Module developers: 6 steps → 1 step |
| 5 | Hot-reloading available ✅ | Module developers: 10x faster iteration |
| 13 | Full toolkit operational | Integration architects: Production-ready async + callbacks |
| 16 | Operational tooling ready | DevOps: Enterprise-grade observability |
| 19 | Complete integration guide | Integration architects: <2 hour first integration |

### Alternative Order (1→2→3→4 vs 1→3→2→4)

**❌ Sequential Order (1→3→2→4):**
- Proposal #2 waits 8 weeks unnecessarily
- Module developers don't get hot-reloading until week 13
- Slower team momentum

**✅ Recommended Order (1→2→3→4):**
- Proposal #2 delivers value in week 5 (7 weeks earlier!)
- Better team momentum with quick win
- Same total timeline
