Overview
--------

The ML programming language is a modern, security-first language that transpiles to Python. It combines familiar syntax with advanced security features like capability-based access control.

Key Features
------------

ðŸ”’ **Security First**
   Built-in capability system prevents unauthorized access to system resources

âš¡ **High Performance**
   Sub-10ms transpilation to optimized Python code

ðŸŽ¯ **Type Safe**
   Optional static typing with inference for better code quality

ðŸ“¦ **Rich Standard Library**
   Comprehensive standard library with secure defaults

ðŸ”§ **Developer Friendly**
   Excellent tooling support with IDE integration

Getting Started
---------------

The fastest way to get started with ML is through the command-line interface:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install mlpy
   pip install mlpy

   # Create a new project
   mlpy init my-project
   cd my-project

   # Run your first program
   mlpy run src/main.ml

This creates a basic project structure and runs your first ML program.
