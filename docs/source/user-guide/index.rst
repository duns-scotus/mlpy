Overview
--------

ML is a dynamically-typed language with static security analysis. Programs are transpiled to Python, giving you access to Python's ecosystem while maintaining ML's security guarantees.

**Key Features:**

* Dynamic typing with runtime type checking
* Capability-based security system
* Comprehensive standard library
* REPL for interactive development
* Source maps for debugging

Learning Path
-------------

1. **Start with the Tutorial**

   The :doc:`tutorial/index` takes you from zero to productive ML programming:

   * Getting started with the REPL
   * Basic syntax and types
   * Control flow and functions
   * Working with data structures

2. **Dive into the Language Reference**

   The :doc:`language-reference/index` provides complete documentation:

   * Lexical structure and keywords
   * Data types and operators
   * Expressions and statements
   * Control flow constructs
   * Functions and closures
   * Built-in functions

3. **Master the mlpy Toolkit**

   The :doc:`toolkit/index` covers practical development tools:

   * REPL - Interactive development environment
   * Transpilation - Code execution and deployment
   * Capabilities - Security and access control

4. **Explore the Standard Library**

   The :doc:`../standard-library/index` covers all built-in modules:

   * builtin - Core language functions
   * console - Logging and debugging
   * math - Mathematical operations
   * regex - Pattern matching
   * datetime - Date and time handling
   * And 7 more modules

Where to Go Next
----------------

* **Beginners:** Start with :doc:`tutorial/getting-started`
* **Python programmers:** See language reference for ML-specific features
* **Security focus:** Review capability system in standard library docs
