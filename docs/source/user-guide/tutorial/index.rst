Tutorial Overview
-----------------

This tutorial follows a progressive learning path:

1. **Getting Started** - Install ML, use the REPL, write your first program
2. **Basic Syntax** - Variables, types, operators, and comments
3. **Control Flow** - Conditionals, loops, and flow control
4. **Functions** - Define and use functions, scope, and patterns
5. **Working with Data** - Arrays, objects, and data processing

Each section includes:

* REPL transcripts showing interactive development
* Complete ML programs demonstrating concepts
* Practical examples from real-world scenarios

Learning Approach
-----------------

**REPL-First Development**

We emphasize the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) as the primary learning tool. The REPL lets you experiment with ML interactively, test ideas quickly, and see results immediately.

**Executable Examples**

Every code example in this tutorial is executable. All examples have been validated through ML's complete pipeline: parsing, security analysis, transpilation, and execution.

**Progressive Complexity**

Each section builds on previous knowledge. Start from the beginning if you're new to ML, or jump to specific topics if you're already familiar with programming.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Basic programming knowledge helpful but not required
* Python 3.12+ installed
* ML (mlpy) installed: ``pip install mlpy``

Getting Help
------------

While learning:

* Use ``help()`` function in REPL to explore functions
* Use ``methods()`` to discover what operations are available
* Use ``typeof()`` to check types when confused
* Check :doc:`../language-reference/index` for detailed syntax

Ready to Start?
---------------

Begin with :doc:`getting-started` to install ML and write your first program.
