  - Added modules to recognized imports list in python_generator.py
  - Resolved "name not defined" errors across multiple test files
  - Consistent import patterns across all standard library modules

- **Exception Handling Syntax**: ML grammar compliance
  - Corrected `catch` → `except` syntax throughout exception_handling_patterns.ml
  - Fixed nested try-except blocks with proper parentheses syntax
  - Aligned with ML grammar specification: `except (identifier) { statements }`
  - Resolved parse errors and moved file to execution stage

### Session Performance Metrics
- **Pipeline Success Rate:** 94.4% through Security/Codegen stages (34/36 files)
- **Execution Success Rate:** 77.8% (28/36 files passing execution)
- **Parse Success Rate:** Maintained at 94.4% with exception handling fixes
- **Standard Library Coverage:** 100% functional with comprehensive method availability
- **Import Resolution:** 100% success rate for functional and regex modules
- **Test Suite Compatibility:** Fixed 5+ major test files with import and syntax issues
